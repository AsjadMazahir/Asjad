    "theorem. It is a probabilistic classifier that uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of a class label given the features of an instance.\n",
    "The Naive Bayes algorithm is a simple and effective algorithm for classification problems. It is based on\n",
    "the assumption that the features of an instance are independent of each other, which is not always true in\n",

    "The Naive Bayes algorithm can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems. For binary\n",
    "classification problems, it can be used to classify instances into one of two classes. For multi-class classification\n",
